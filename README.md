## What is KABOOM?
The best way to explain what KABOOM is meant to be is the 'TMDb of comics and cartoons' - a comic tracker/database. Currently its just a skeleton, the only way to interface with the database is through the Django API - there is no frontend. Hopefully in the future there will be multiple different clients built off of the API, abit like Trakt. The database includes metadata for comics and cartoons, as well as some user accounts functionality.

## Should I use KABOOM?
No. Especially in the current state it's in. There is no *usable* data in the database and the user accounts system is not implemented yet. There may also be security issues, I am the only developer and I don't have much web tech experience, so the user account system may not be as secure as it could be. Currently KABOOM is just an experimental hobby project, we'll see where it goes from there.
