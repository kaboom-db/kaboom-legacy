## Developer Guidelines

Before creating your client, you must read through these simple rules and guidelines:
1. When testing API requests please use the staging server available here: https://staging-kaboom.herokuapp.com/v1. This will allow data uploads and supplies a test user for requests that need a user to be logged in. The [Postman Collection]() also includes the users accesstoken.
2. Do not abuse the API. The current rate limit is 60 requests per 60 seconds.
3. Do not post test data to the production server.

For ease, there is a pre-made [Postman collection]() available for use that utilises the staging server and a demo accesstoken.
